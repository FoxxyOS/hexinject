Description: Versatile packet injector and sniffer
 HexInject is a very versatile packet injector and sniffer, 
 that provide a command-line framework for raw network 
 access.
 .
 It's designed to work together with others command-line 
 utilities, and for this reason it facilitates the creation 
 of powerful shell scripts capable of reading, intercepting 
 and modifying network traffic in a transparent manner.
